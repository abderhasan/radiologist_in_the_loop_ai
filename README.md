This is the official GitHub repository for the [Radiologist-in-the-Loop AI Tutorial](https://radiologistintheloop.ai/) at MICCAI 2023! This repository serves as a companion to the tutorial, providing resources, code examples, and materials to enhance your learning experience. ðŸ§ ðŸ’»ðŸ“š

## Setup

The code in this repository is meant for performing binary classification, which involves distinguishing between two classes. In the context of the tutorial, the classification task focused on identifying whether a given ultrasound image contains the liver region or not. 

Assume your class names are `A` and `B`. In your main project folder, do the following:

1. Create a folder called `data` within your project directory.

2. Inside the `data` folder, create the following subfolders:
   - `unlabeled`: This folder will contain images without any assigned class labels.
   - `training`: This folder contains the images used for training the neural network.
   - `validation`: This folder contains the images used for neural network validation.
   - `test`: This folder contains the images used for testing the trained model.

3. Within the `training`, `validation', and `test` subfolders, create two more subfolders for each class:
   - For `training` create folders named `A` and `B`.
   - For `validation` create folders named `A` and `B`.
   - For `test` create folders named `A` and `B`.

4. Place the images that belong to each class into their respective `A` and `B` folders within the `training`, `validation`, and `test` subfolders. Those images represent the labeled data.

5. The `unlabeled` folder should contain images that have not been assigned to any specific class.

Your folder structure should now look as follows:

## 1. Uncertainty sampling

### 1.1. Train the binary classifier

Assuming you have images in the `validation` and `test` folders, you can begin by randomly selecting (and assigning labels to) two images from the `unlabeled` folder. At this stage, ensure that one image is assigned to class `A`, and the other image is assigned to class `B`.

Now, run the [`simple_classifier.py`](https://github.com/abderhasan/radiologist_in_the_loop_ai/blob/main/simple_classifier.py) script. Once the script finishes running, it will output the accuracy of the trained model when applied to the test dataset. Additionally, it will generate a file named `unlabeled_probabilities.csv`. This file contains the probability distribution for the unlabeled images located in your `unlabeled` folder. The format of the CSV file is as follows:

</div>

### 1.2. Find least confidence scores

To calculate the least confidence score from the probability distribution for each prediction, run the [`least_confidence_score.py`](https://github.com/abderhasan/radiologist_in_the_loop_ai/blob/main/least_confidence_score.py) script. The primary parameters required for this script are the input and output CSV files. In the script, these are defined as follows:

```python
input_csv_file = 'unlabeled_probabilities.csv'
output_csv_file = 'least_confidence_scores.csv'
```

The results in `least_confidence_scores.csv` will be sorted in ascending order. So, the content in the CSV file would look something like the following:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/abderhasan/radiologist_in_the_loop_ai/blob/main/imgs/table_2.png" alt="table" width="500"/>
</div>

### 1.3. Sample data for labeling

Having calculated the least confidence scores, we will now select the top *N* samples that will be labeled by the domain expert (i.e., radiologist). To accomplish this, you can execute the `select_data.py` script; in this script, the first *50* samples are selected, but you can change the number of samples you would like to select.

### 1.4. Add new labeled data to the training dataset

In the previous step, you selected a sample of data and labeled it. These newly labeled images would now be added to your existing training dataset. Let's say you chose 50 images to label. If your training data initially contained *2* images, after adding the newly labeled images, your training dataset should now have a total of *52* images.

Once you've completed this step, go ahead and run the [`simple_classifier.py`](https://github.com/abderhasan/radiologist_in_the_loop_ai/blob/main/simple_classifier.py) script. This will train your model again, but this time using the updated training dataset. If the model's classification performance (i.e., test accuracy) still doesn't meet your expectations, you should go back and repeat steps 1.1 through 1.4.

## 2. Diversity sampling

</div>

### 2.1. Train the binary classifier

This is similar to step 1.1, except that you don't need the [`test_and_save_probabilities_unlabeled()`](https://github.com/abderhasan/radiologist_in_the_loop_ai/blob/main/simple_classifier.py#L125) function in `simple_classifier.py`. So, you can comment out the function from the classifier when working on diversity sampling.

### 2.2. K-means

To categorize unlabeled data into distinct groups, you can use the [`k_means.py`](https://github.com/abderhasan/radiologist_in_the_loop_ai/blob/main/k_means.py) script. In this script, you can specify the number of clusters you want, which is denoted as `k`. For example, in this script `k=5`, which will create 5 clusters. 

The script will generate *k* CSV files, named as `class_1.csv`, `class_2.csv`, ..., `class_5.csv`. Each of these CSV files contains information about the images assigned to its respective class. This information includes the image's name, whether it serves as the representative centroid image for that class, and if the image is identified as an outlier. The content in the CSV file would look something like the following:
